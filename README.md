## Developer Instructions

### Configuring and running locally

Pre-Requisites:
- Git
- Python 3.9+
- PostgreSQL
- Mailgun API Key (if you wish to send out emails while testing)

#### Clone repo, create virtual environment, and install requirements

```sh
git clone https://github.com/eyarham/refundcleveland.git
cd refundcleveland
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Start a PostgreSQL Container with Docker Compose

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
1. Open Docker Desktop
1. From the repository directory, run `docker compose up -d`
1. Run the command `python3 manage.py migrate` within the command line to create tables within your database.

#### Add local settings

Copy and rename **local_settings_template.py** to **local_settings.py**, and fill in environmental variables:

`SECRET_KEY` -- Djangoâ€™s Secret Key used by the project
`GOOGLE_API_KEY` -- Used for Google's Civic Information API to map Address to Political Ward
`MAILGUN_API_KEY` -- Used for the Mailgun API that sends out emails when a user submits a budget

`DATABASES` -- map of parameters to define the connection to a database.  In prod, we are using a postgres db hosted on heroku, and the connection is injected there via config vars.  For local versions, enter the information you used when creating the database.  Example:
```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'refund1',
        'USER': 'postgres',
        'PASSWORD': '<password>',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

#### Run the app

```sh
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8000/

### Running in a production environment
This is currently done through heroku.

### Dependencies
We used the following open source libraries/tools:
d3, django, python3, postgres, Google Civic Information API

### Note on Patches/Pull Requests 

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Send us a pull request. Bonus points for making a new name your branch that describes your changes. For example, if you're improving the css by adding margins for input range element, `css-range-margins` would be appropriate.
